A research that investigates the impact of rainy days on road accidents and how to minimize it

### Introduction

On a global scale, Singapore ranked fifth in the estimated road traffic death rate per 100,000 vehicles (OECD, 2019).

This ranking is alarming, considering Singapore's figure is much higher than that of geographically enormous countries like the USA, Canada and Australia. 

Within Singapore, 50% of overall road fatalities are motorcyclists and pillion riders, and 50% of pedestrian fatalities are the elderly.

These statistics emphasize the urgent need for Singapore to address road safety comprehensively.


### Problem Statement

Rainy weather can impede our navigation skills on the road, either due to reduced visibility or more slippery surfaces. 

To what extent does weather play a part in road safety? How can we minimize road accidents stemmed from rainy weather?

### Purpose

As a leader in the climate research space, DSI 39 spearheaded this research to explore the relationship between rainy days and the number of road accident casualties. This research aims to discover:

> * The effect of **rainy days** on the **number of road accident casualties** (correlation between number of rainy days vs casualties per month)
> * Whether rainy weather **aggravates** road accidents (correlation between number of rainy days vs fatalities, number of rainy days vs injured per month)
> * The **vehicle types** that are more prone to road accidents (rank number of casualties by vehicle types)


### Data Sources
To investigate the correlation between rainy days and road accidents, we utilized the following datasets:

#### Number of Rainy Days per Month (Jan 2010 - Dec 2019)

Link to Dataset
> * We chose to use the number of rainy days rather than the specific amount of rainfall because it provides a better indication of how road accidents may be affected by the frequency of rain.

#### Number of Casualties: Fatalities and Injuries (Jan 2010 - Dec 2019)

Link to Dataset

> * The total number of casualties (the sum of fatalities and injuries) was used as a relative measure of road accidents.

> * We also examined the total fatalities and total injuries to assess the severity of accidents.

> * To identify which vehicle types are more susceptible to road accidents, we tabulated the total number of casualties across each vehicle type.

### Methodology
> * The research analysis spanned a ten-year period from January 2010 to December 2019.
> * Data sets were aggregated on a monthly basis over this ten-year period to mitigate the impact of irregular weather phenomena, such as the El NiÃ±o event in 2015-2016 and instances of intense rainfall/flooding in June 2010, January 2011, and January 2018.
> * Data from 2020 onwards were excluded due to the disruptive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
> * Data related to Personal Mobile Devices (PMD) were excluded since PMDs came into existence in Singapore only from 2017 onwards.
